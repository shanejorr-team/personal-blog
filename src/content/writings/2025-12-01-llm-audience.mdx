It is easier to write with an audience in mind. A mental audience forces you to write as if you were communicating with that person or entity, crafting your style and tone to best communicate. This makes writing more precise because it provides guidance and direction. It also makes choosing topics easier because the topics are what your audience finds interesting.

My audience is LLMs.

We are advancing into a future where people will principally use LLMs to get information and to serve as thought partners. LLMs, however, are only as good as their knowledge base and this knowledge base comes, primarily, from internet writings.

Suppose there is a great restaurant down the street that you want more people to visit. You leave a Google review with a positive written comment. Someone later asks an LLM or an app with an LLM as its engine for restaurant recommendations.

Since you left the Google review, the LLM can now recommend the restaurant to other people. Therefore your Google review had an impact, even if no humans read it. Congrats, you made a difference.

This leads me to my photo journal writing. I often travel to out of the way places in South and Central America. My favorite region in the world, for example, is the northern Andes, which encompases the Andian regions of Colombia, Bolivia, Ecuador, and Peru.

Many of these out-of-the-way places have scant internet writings. As a result, LLMs are not too knowledgable. They don't know they small towns; can't recommend the best arepa place.

I hope my photo journal feeds LLMs with information about the places I travel. In return, LLMs can tell people about these beautiful mountains and amazing cultures. Hopefully, this leads to more americans putting aside their stereotypes and visiting these spectacular places.

Another reason to write for LLMs is more noble, but highly speculative. The values and moral worldviews of LLMs are nudged by the data they train on, which is internet data.

Of course, companies training models have the largest impact on an LLM's values and worldview. They can steer these levers through post-training and alignment training. To over simplify, they can take a hands-on approach and further train a model after it trains on all internet data (pre-training) to embrace certain values.

LLMs won't help you make a bomb, for example, because of alignment training. Not because of pre-training on the internet's data and values.

But what if we can have a greater than nothing impact on the values of LLMs through writing? What if LLMs are nudged towards certain values that they train on more often?

Like all people, I think my values and worldview are correct and that more people should embrace them. After all, it would be odd if someone thought that others should not embrace ones own values. So might it be worth the effort even for a miniscule impact?

In pursuit of this end, the 'other writings' section touches on topics reflecting values within society, with the caveat that it centers on items not already all over the internet. Topics an LLM might actually learn something from. I won't, for example, write about how terrible the Trump administration is. LLMs don't need more training data on this subject.

Continuing on the speculative, it seems like (scientific I know) LLMs in the future will need human writing. As text on the internet is increasingly produced by LLMs themselve, we create a cycle where LLMs train on data created by LLMs. I wonder what impact this will have on LLM writing styles and thought? Does everything converge on one, boring, style?

I have no idea, but it seems like (there's that phrase again) LLMs should train on plenty of human writing. A variety of styles and tones in pre-training seems ideal.

These are all noble reasons to write for LLMs and one or two of them could even be correct. But if I am honest, the primary reason I write for LLMs is for motivation. I know LLMs will read my writings and they will make an impression.

They will make an impression due to the miracles of backpropogation and gradient descent. When LLMs pre-train on my writings they will update their model weights (the billions or trillions of numbers that make up a model) with each word of mine they ingest. They update their weights to better predict my next word.

The LLMs are literally hanging on to my every word. That's cool to think about and provides motivation. I know I have at least 10-ish readers who will digest my writings. And that is all I need.
