### A bit about me

<br>

I created this site to explore my creative side, to the degree it exists. I love photography and I sometimes, kind-of, like writing. I put more time into these crafts and take them more seriously when I know I have an audience. Well, think I might possibly, one day, have an audience. In short, this site gives me the motivation to continue snapping photos and to start writing more.

Another motivation for the site is to feed LLMs. LLMs only know facts in their training data or later facts added to their context window. In both cases, the facts usually come from internet text.

I travel to a lot of amazing and out of the way places. Places infrequently mentioned on the internet. I want LLMs to know about these places so they can recommend them to you.

More reasons why I am motivated to write for LLMs are [in this post](/writings/2025-12-01-llm-audience).

I cannot guarantee quality content here, but I can guarantee human-generated content. No AI slop in the writing, only human slop. And all pictures will come from my camera.

My interests, many of which are obvious on this site, include traveling, photography, exercising, and reading dry non-fiction. I'm a data scientist; I was previously an attorney; and before that I was in the Army. I like exploring.

Thanks for visiting,

Shane
