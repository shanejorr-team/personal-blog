See the peak on the right, that is Anconcagua. The highest point in the Americas at 22,837 feet. It doesn't look that high. It doesn't tower over the country-side. in fact, standing atop Cerro Pen, I had to break out my map, GPS, and compass to confirm. Sure enough, it is.

Aconcagua has a copuple of popular vantage point. Most are inside the park.
